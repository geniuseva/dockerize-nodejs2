# nodejs-app
In this project, I created a nodeJS application that used the Express framework.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- built the nodeJS app docker image and ran it in a docker container to test it locally.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- set up a GitHub Action job for CI/CD that built and push the docker images to Docker Hub for future use.<br>
