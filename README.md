# nodejs-app
In this project, I created a nodeJS application that used the Express framework.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. I built the nodeJS app docker image and ran it in a docker container to test it locally.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. I set up a GitHub Action job for CI/CD that built and push the docker images to Docker Hub for future use.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. I pulled the stored image from the Docker Hub repository and build another container locally, to showcase how we can recreate and scale the application with Docker.<br>
